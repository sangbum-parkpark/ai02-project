0,Tihota Eau de Parfum,Indult," Rapa Nui for sugar, Tihota is, quite simply, The One. The One that will call to you every moment you're not smelling it, The One that you've only had hints of in other vanilla perfumes, The One that lasts and lasts, The One that has perfectly captured the essence of the pure nature of fresh vanilla beans and has harnessed it beyond your wildest dreams. It inspires obsessive devotion with its fragrance of smooth, vanilla bean pods dipped in honeyed water and left to steep. The result is the pure magic, an unbridled vanilla, sweet, raw and achingly desirable. Of course, Tihota isn't the first perfume to focus on the dark sweetness of vanilla... perfumery is filled with vanillas, but this smells like the dream of a master perfumer who was obsessed with vanilla and was finally given free rein to worship the note with no apologies. It is, without a sliver of a doubt, the finest pure vanilla we've ever had the honor of carrying, and it's so beautiful it pains us to put the bottle down."," Vanilla bean, musks",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37401.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

2,Kagiroi Parfum,Di Ser," An aromatic ode to the ancient beauty of Japan, Kagiroi represents the changes in the shade of the dawn sky over the mountains of Hokkaido, Japan. As the dawn sky transitions through shades of purple, yellow, orange and red, this scent that showcases many ingredients used for the first time in perfumery transitions from an aromatic slightly spicy top to an earthy and woody base, representing the ebb and flow in the stages of life. The perfume opens with notes of Japanese herbs and citruses, moves to a slightly floral spicy middle and settles into a deep woody base accentuated by the use of the Hinoki cedar that dot the mountain landscapes. A deeply personal and spiritual scent, Kagiroi is a scent of shifting aromatic complexities representing transitions in the journey of life.Parfum Edition: We are honored and delighted to offer the rare and precious Parfum edition of Kagiroi, which adds to the composition a precious specimen of Japanese agarwood, which adds rich, spiritual dimensionality and a truly impressive and long-lasting drydown to this already complex and wonderful scent."," Green yuzu, green shikuwasa, sansho seed, coriander, ylang-ylang, shiso, rosewood, vetiver, hinoki, cypriol, patchouli, agarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/788012.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

4,A Blvd. Called Sunset Eau de Parfum,A Lab on Fire," There's no way A Lab On Fire could relocate to Los Angeles and not pay tribute to L.A.'s most iconic Boulevard, home to the legendary neon-drenched rock stages of the Strip, the crashing waves of the Palisades, and everything in between. The result is A Blvd. Called Sunset, a bright, fresh, just the right amount of edgy journey across our wild and beautiful city. Bright, fresh bergamot sparkles in a smooth, salty, almond-inflected breeze, while a masculine leaning-floral blend of violet and jasmine combines with a leather that evokes the biker bars and metal clubs so famously captured in Ed Ruscha's seminal photo book. A smooth, intoxicating base of sandalwood, vanilla, and tonka goes down like a perfect mixed drink, comforting and sensual all at once. If you ever get a chance to take a trip down Sunset, there's nothing like it in the world. But the next best thing is a day spent wearing A Blvd. Called Sunset- a perfect tribute to the heart and soul of Los Angeles."," Bergamot, almond, violet, jasmine, leather, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56719.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

6,Exit the King Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange," In these tumultuous times, a fragrance that celebrates destruction and dethronement might seem... risky. But Etat Libre was never about playing it safe, and Exit The King, like all their best releases, is risky in all the best ways, a you've-never-smelled-anything-quite-like-this fragrance that tears down the contours of a classical chypre to uncover a blindingly fresh, delightfully sexy new regime. An immaculate blend of contrasts: electrically overdosed florals, sparkling fresh soap foam, and the sharp green of tree moss, all set against a woodsy, milky blend of patchouli and sandalwood. It's both comfortably familiar, but thrillingly new- a modern, stylish floral that's both everyday perfect, and secret weapon good."," Timur JE, Soap Foam Accord (Aldehydes & Musk), Pink Pepper, Jasmine e-pure, Rose Superessence, Lily-of-the-valley Accord, Patchouli, Moss Absolute, Sandalwood Accord & Orcanox",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/477053.jpg?width=400&404=product.png

10,Nocturnal Poetry Parfum,PRIN," Who says a nightmare needs to be a bad experience?
